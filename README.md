These example projects were created as part of a course teaching students at 
UROC(https://uroc.umn.edu/) how to program using godot.

It uses a few online resources, (tilemaps, images, font file, and the dialogic plugin)
I've included them so that the sample programs work, in addition I've included license information for
each item that was included, please respect their licenses.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks,

Kent
